## How to Run:

Run the Game.java file

If I blue background is all that shows up then ensure that the directory that is open is the one containing the code and not its parent directory. If that still doesn't work open the images in the Textures folder to ensure that they are loaded. Finnally if that does not work use the terminal to open the folder and run 

`javac Game.java`

`java Game.java`

In order to compile and run the source code

## How to Play:

Navigate the menu using the up and down arrows and select an option with the space key. The rest of the controls and the goal of the game can be viewed under the tutorial tab in the main menu.
